 Working on full scripted install but for now follow below steps:
 ! assumes only 2 drives named based on ada naming scheme set up in mirror
 1) graphical install system
 2) enter shell to partition
 3) use ZFS.sh
 4) exit shell and continue installation, "finish install", <Live CD> 
 5) use ZFS2.sh
 6) reboot into ZFS based FreeBSD system
